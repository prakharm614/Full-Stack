This repository documents my personal journey of learning **ReactJS** through the **"Chai aur Code"** tutorial series by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary).
Here, I’ll be sharing **concept-wise code**, **mini-projects**, and **practice exercises** that I build while learning React — from basics to advanced topics.

* **Hands-On Implementation**: Includes small demos, assignments, and components built while learning.
